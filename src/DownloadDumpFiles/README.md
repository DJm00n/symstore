# Sample Dump Symbols Downloader #
  
This is a proof of concept implementation of downloading all the files needed for debugging using [SSQP](../../docs/specs/Simple_Symbol_Query_Protocol.md)  
  
## Running the example ##

TODO: Add more complete instructions

You run the tool with arguments <dump\_file\_path> <symbol\_server\_url> <file\_cache>

I've only tested it with machO based dumps but adding ELF dumps should be straightforward and we can add a simple windows minidump format parser

## Further exploration ##
